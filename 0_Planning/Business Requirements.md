# üè• Healthcare Case Study ‚Äì Business Intelligence & Data Analysis

##  Stakeholder Background & Meeting Transcript

##  Project Background

The project is initiated by **MedCare Group**, a network of 5 regional hospitals operating across the country.  
Over the last year, the organization faced **declining patient satisfaction** and **rising operational costs**.  
Leadership decided to invest in **Business Intelligence** to gain actionable insights and improve overall hospital performance.

The goal was to design a **centralized BI solution** that integrates patient, financial, and operational data ‚Äî enabling real-time decision-making and improving healthcare outcomes.

##  Stakeholder Meeting Transcript ‚Äì Kickoff Session

**Date:** 10 February 2024  
**Location:** MedCare HQ, Executive Conference Room  
**Attendees:**  
- **Dr. Sarah Williams** (Chief Medical Officer)  
- **Mark Thompson** (Head of Operations)  
- **Lisa Rodriguez** (BI & Analytics Manager ‚Äì *Your Role*)  
- **IT Department Representative**

### **Opening**

> **Dr. Sarah:**  
> ‚ÄúOur hospitals are under strain. Patient satisfaction has dropped 12% this quarter. We‚Äôre also seeing inconsistent bed utilization ‚Äî some departments are overbooked while others have idle capacity.‚Äù

> **Mark:**  
> ‚ÄúWe need data-backed decisions. I want to know *which regions and departments* are struggling the most. For example, how long are patients waiting before treatment? Are we overstaffed or understaffed during certain shifts?‚Äù

> **Lisa (You):**  
> ‚ÄúI propose we develop a BI dashboard that integrates data from all five hospitals. It‚Äôll highlight KPIs like patient flow, bed occupancy, treatment costs, and readmission rates. We can also include satisfaction trends and predictive forecasts.‚Äù

> **Dr. Sarah:**  
> ‚ÄúExcellent. And please ensure it‚Äôs easy for department heads to filter by *region, doctor, or diagnosis*. We want clarity, not complexity.‚Äù

> **Mark:**  
> ‚ÄúAgreed. I also want a focus on operational efficiency ‚Äî linking *costs, staffing, and patient outcomes*. Let‚Äôs be able to see if a higher doctor workload impacts satisfaction.‚Äù

> **Saad (Me):**  
> ‚ÄúUnderstood. We‚Äôll start with a historical dataset of 12 months ‚Äî admissions, treatments, satisfaction, costs, and insurance data ‚Äî then move to trend and predictive modeling.‚Äù

> **Dr. Sarah:**  
> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a solid plan. Let‚Äôs make sure the insights help us improve patient care while maintaining financial balance.‚Äù
